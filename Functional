#Adapter Design Pattern
   Its a structural design pattern. It work as a bridge between two incompatable Interface.
#Real Life Example
   1. Card Reader Which act as an adapter between memory and pc
#When to Use Adapter Design Pattern?
   1. Allows system to use class of another system.
   2. Sometime a library can not be used becaus its interface is incompatible with the interface required by an application
#Alternative
    Faced is the alternative to Adapter design pattern.
#Types
    1.Deligation(Object Adapter)
    2.Inheritance(Class Adapter)
    Deligation(Object Adapter): It represent weak relationship(aggregation). In this process property of adaptee class is called by 
    creating object.
    
    Inheritance(Class Adapter):It represent weak relationship(composition). In this process property of adaptee class is called by 
    implementing adaptee class.

#Compotite  Design Pattern
    Composite design pattern allow you to have tree structure and ask each node to perform same task(means whatever operation you
    can perform on leaf noad should be applicable in parent node).
    This patttern creates tree structure of multiple object.
    
#Real Life Example
     Computer Can be devided into two node 1.cabinate 2. peripheral. Cabinate some child node 1.Processor 2. RAM 
     Peripheral containss child node 1. Key board 2. Mouse
     As we know same operation should be applicable in all noad (So if we can find value of individual cost of Processor and RAM the
     we should be able to find commulative cost of peripheral.
